# git-go

A small [Git](https://www.git-scm.com/) implementation written in [Go](https://go.dev/).

The main goals of this project were to learn about Git internals and Go. This small Git implementation is capable of initializing a repository, creating commits and cloning a public repository.

## Features

### Commands

Basic commands:
- `init`:        Initialize the git directory structure
- `commit`:      Record changes to the repository
- `log`:         Show commit logs for a commit ID

Plumbing commands:
- `cat-file`:    Provide content or type and size information for repository objects
- `hash-object`: Compute object ID and optionally creates a blob from a file
- `ls-tree`: 	List the contents of a tree object
- `write-tree`: 	Create a tree object from the current working directory
- `commit-tree`: Create a new commit object

Remote commands:
- `clone`:       Clone a repository into a new directory
- `ls-remote`:   List references in a remote repository

### Clone

Clone command is implemented using the smart HTTP protocol only. What it does:
1. Discover references in the remote repository
2. Negotiate packfile transfer
3. Transfer and unpack packfile (with deltas unpacking)

Clone uses loose objects, unpacking the packfile fully to `.git/objects`.
